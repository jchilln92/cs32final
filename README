TOWER WARS

How to run
----------

You can compile the source yourself, or run the provided jar file located at bin/TowerWars.jar.  Note that the jar doesn't contain any of the 
image assets needed for the game, so run it in the top level directory (the same directory as this file).  Simply run:

	java -jar bin/TowerWars.jar
	
from the top level directory to start the game.

Issues
------
- Although autodiscovery is provided by the kryonet library, it doesn't seem to work in the Sunlab properly, so we were forced to work around this
	by quickly checking each machine in a list of machines to see if it is hosting a game.  This works well within the Sunlab.  If you need to add other computers
	to the list, please see src/net/SunlabAutodiscoveryHack.java.  This is where the names of machines to check are stored.
	
- The game is extremely unbalanced.  If the "HTA" tower is ever obtained, the game is basically over.  All aspects of towers and their upgrades, as well as the
	attributes of the creeps, are located in the XML files in assets/xml.  You'll also find map definitions here.
